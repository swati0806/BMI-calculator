                            compares to common
                            values. Body Mass Index (or BMI) is calculated as your weight (in kilograms) divided by the
                            square of your height (in metres) or BMI = Kg/M^2..</p>

                    <p>The BMI is
                        universally expressed in kg/m^2, resulting from mass in
                        kilograms and height in
                        metres.<br> If pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor of 703 (kg/m^2)/(lb/in^2) must be
                        applied. When the
                        term BMI is used informally, the units are usually omitted.<br>

                        BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health
                        professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. BMI was designed
                        to be used as a
                        simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average
                        body
                        composition.<br>For such individuals, the value recommendations are as follows: a BMI from 18.5
                        up
                        to 25 kg/m^2 may
                        indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight, a number from
                        25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a number from 30 upwards suggests the
                        person is
                        obese.Lean male athletes often have a high muscle-to-fat ratio and therefore a BMI that is
                        misleadingly
                        high relative to their body-fat percentage.

                </h1>
                <p class="lead text-justify"><br>
                <p>Obesity is a
                    condition
                    that occurs when a person has excess weight or body fat that might affect their health. A doctor
                    will usually suggest that a person has obesity if they have a high body mass index (BMI).<br>

                    BMI is a tool that doctors use to assess whether or not a person has an appropriate weight for their
                    age, sex, and height. It combines a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their
                    height in meters.<br>
                    Having a BMI between 25 and 29.9 indicates that a person is carrying excess weight. A person has
                    obesity if their BMI is 30 or over.<br>

                    Certain other factors — such as a person’s waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and amount and
                    distribution of fat — also play a role in determining how healthy their weight is.

                        BMI</u>
                </h1>
                <p class="lead text-justify" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br>
                <p>Although BMI is a
                    widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight, it does have its limitations. BMI is only
                    an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as
                    well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along with other
                    measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body
                    weight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    BMI cannot be fully accurate because it is a measure of excess body weight, rather than excess body
                    fat. BMI is further influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, and body fat,
                    and activity level, among others. For example, an older person who is considered a healthy weight,
                    but is completely inactive in their daily life may have significant amounts of excess body fat even
                    though they are not heavy. This would be considered unhealthy, while a younger person with higher
                    muscle composition of the same BMI would be considered healthy. In athletes, particularly
                    bodybuilders who would be considered overweight due to muscle being heavier than fat, it is entirely
                    possible that they are actually at a healthy weight for their body composition. Generally, according
                    to the CDC:

                    The same factors that limit the efficacy of BMI for adults can also apply to children and
                    adolescents. Additionally, height and level of sexual maturation can influence BMI and body fat
                    among children. BMI is a better indicator of excess body fat for obese children than it is for
                    overweight children, whose BMI could be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass
                    (all body components except for fat, which includes water, organs, muscle, etc.). In thin children,
                    the difference in BMI can also be due to fat-free mass.
